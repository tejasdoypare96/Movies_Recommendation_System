# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview:
The Movie Recommendation System is a project that leverages machine learning techniques to recommend movies based on user preferences. The system is designed to predict and suggest movies that a user may like based on the features of movies they have rated in the past.

## Features:
1) Content-Based Filtering: The system uses a content-based approach by analyzing various features such as genre, keywords, cast, and crew to recommend similar movies.
2) Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, feature extraction, and transformation.
3) Modeling: Utilizes various machine learning algorithms to build the recommendation model.
4) Deployment: The project is deployed using Streamlit to provide an interactive interface for users.
